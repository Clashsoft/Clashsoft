#### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi there, I'm Adrian and currently a PhD Student of Computer Science.
Feel free to take a look around my profile, during my studies and as a hobby I created many different software projects.
Not all of them are in my personal profile, so check out some of the awesome organizations that I worked in:

- [Dyvil](https://github.com/Dyvil) - A modern JVM programming language.
- [Distributed Systems Uni Kassel](https://github.com/ds-ukassel) - Projects at the Distributed Systems group in Kassel.
- [Software Engineering Uni Kassel](https://github.com/sekassel-research) - Projects at the Software Engineering Research group in Kassel.
- [Fujaba](https://github.com/fujaba) - The Fulib Tool Suite for developer productivity.
- [Clashsoft-Mods](https://github.com/Clashsoft-Mods) - My old Minecraft modding projects.
- [Minestrappolation](https://github.com/MinestrapTeam) - Also Minecraft modding, but a larger project and team.

#### üè† Websites

Want to see my work without reading a bunch of code?
Here are some of my showoff projects, available to all on the web:

- [app.clashsoft.de](https://app.clashsoft.de) - A bunch of minor projects that I put together into one web app.
- [coffee.uni-kassel.dev](https://coffee.uni-kassel.dev/) - Coffee Counter and amenity finance tracker for the VS/SE offices.

- [fulib.org](https://www.fulib.org) - A modern software engineering platform, featuring experimental modeling languages, a web IDE, homework grading, etc.

Most of these are made with Angular (frontend), NestJS (backend), MongoDB (database), Nx (workspace/build) and my own [Mean-Stream](https://github.com/Clashsoft/Meanstream) library.
